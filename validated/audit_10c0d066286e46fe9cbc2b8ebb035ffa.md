### Title
Storage-Deposit Refunds Freed by GC Are Permanently Locked With No Withdrawal Path — (`contract/src/lib.rs`)

---

### Summary

`submit_blocks` accepts NEAR deposits to cover storage staking costs. When the garbage collector (`run_mainchain_gc`) later frees that storage, the released storage-staking NEAR becomes liquid balance inside the contract account. No withdrawal function exists anywhere in the contract, so this NEAR accumulates permanently with no recovery path — a direct analog to the Entropy/Executor locked-funds class.

---

### Finding Description

`submit_blocks` is marked `#[payable]` and collects a deposit from the caller to cover the net storage increase caused by inserting new block headers. [1](#0-0) 

The function computes `required_deposit` as the net storage delta multiplied by `env::storage_byte_cost()`, refunds only the immediate surplus to `predecessor_account_id`, and retains the rest as storage staking inside the contract account. [2](#0-1) 

`run_mainchain_gc` is a separate, publicly callable function (no deposit required, no access-control restriction beyond the pause flag) that deletes old mainchain block headers from `headers_pool` and `mainchain_height_to_header`. [3](#0-2) 

In NEAR Protocol, deleting storage entries releases the corresponding storage-staking NEAR back to the contract account as **liquid balance**. Once liquid, those tokens can only leave the account via an explicit `Promise::transfer` call. No such call — and no withdrawal function of any kind — exists anywhere in the contract's public API. [4](#0-3) 

The entire public surface of `BtcLightClient` is: `init`, `submit_blocks`, `get_*` view functions, `verify_transaction_inclusion{,_v2}`, `run_mainchain_gc`, and `migrate`. None of them transfer the contract's own liquid balance to any external account. [5](#0-4) 

---

### Impact Explanation

Every production deployment is configured with `gc_threshold = 52704` (approximately one year of Bitcoin blocks). Once the chain grows past that threshold, GC runs on every `submit_blocks` call, continuously freeing storage and converting storage-staking NEAR into permanently inaccessible liquid balance inside the contract. The recommended deposit constant `STORAGE_DEPOSIT_PER_BLOCK` is applied per block, so over a year of operation the locked amount scales linearly with the number of submitted headers. There is no upgrade-free recovery path; the NEAR is irrecoverable without a contract upgrade. [6](#0-5) 

---

### Likelihood Explanation

This is a certainty under normal operation, not a probabilistic risk. The recommended `gc_threshold` guarantees GC activates after roughly one year of block submissions. After that point, every `submit_blocks` call frees storage and adds to the locked balance. The trigger requires no adversarial input — it is the normal relayer workflow. [7](#0-6) 

---

### Recommendation

Add an authorized withdrawal function (callable only by `Role::DAO`) that transfers the contract's liquid balance to a designated treasury account:

```rust
#[access_control_any(roles(Role::DAO))]
pub fn withdraw_liquid_balance(&mut self, amount: NearToken, recipient: AccountId) -> Promise {
    Promise::new(recipient).transfer(amount)
}
```

Alternatively, when `run_mainchain_gc` frees storage, immediately forward the released NEAR to a pre-configured treasury address rather than leaving it as liquid balance in the contract account.

---

### Proof of Concept

1. Relayer calls `submit_blocks` with 100 headers and a deposit of `100 * STORAGE_DEPOSIT_PER_BLOCK`. The contract stores all headers; `required_deposit` is consumed as storage staking; any surplus is refunded.
2. The chain grows past `gc_threshold`. On the next `submit_blocks` call, `run_mainchain_gc(num_of_headers)` deletes old entries from `headers_pool` and `mainchain_height_to_header`.
3. NEAR Protocol releases the storage staking for those deleted entries back to the contract account as liquid balance.
4. An operator attempts to recover the freed NEAR. There is no function to call. The NEAR is permanently locked in the contract account. [8](#0-7)

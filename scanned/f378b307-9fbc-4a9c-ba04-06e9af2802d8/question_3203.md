# Q3203: Dialect execution apply/quote nesting around allocator restore via strict canonical rejection versus successful round trip

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `Dialect` in `wheel/python/clvm_rs/chia_dialect.py` through public CLVM execution through `Dialect` using run_program, ChiaDialect, RuntimeDialect, or Python execution wrapper, using a crafted apply/quote nesting around allocator restore input and the strict canonical rejection versus successful round trip validation path while controlling path-selected environment trees, so the code leaking softfork or allocator state into later evaluation, given that the path is reachable through documented clvm_rs Rust or Python APIs used by wallets, nodes, or testnet services, violating the invariant that operator availability must follow active dialect and softfork state and causing Critical consensus divergence: identical spend bytes evaluate differently?

## Target
- File/function: wheel/python/clvm_rs/chia_dialect.py::Dialect
- Entrypoint: public CLVM execution through `Dialect` using run_program, ChiaDialect, RuntimeDialect, or Python execution wrapper
- Attacker controls: path-selected environment trees
- Exploit idea: Build the smallest CLVM blob/program/API call for apply/quote nesting around allocator restore, drive it through strict canonical rejection versus successful round trip, and compare result node, error class, cost, serialized bytes, and tree hash against the equivalent supported path.
- Invariant to test: operator availability must follow active dialect and softfork state
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical consensus divergence: identical spend bytes evaluate differently
- Fast validation: compare direct API, round-trip API, and reference CLVM behavior on the same crafted input; reject out-of-scope crash/DoS/performance-only/docs/tests/scripts/disabled-config/downstream-misuse outcomes.

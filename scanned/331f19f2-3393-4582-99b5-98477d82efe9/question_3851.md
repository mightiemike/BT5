# Q3851: opcode by name execution softfork guard followed by disabled opcode via read cache lookup before and after pop

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `opcode_by_name` in `src/f_table.rs` through public CLVM execution through `opcode_by_name` using run_program, ChiaDialect, RuntimeDialect, or Python execution wrapper, using a crafted softfork guard followed by disabled opcode input and the read cache lookup before and after pop validation path while controlling quote/apply/softfork program atoms, so the code returning result/error/cost different from an equivalent supported path, given that no privileged role, leaked key, admin action, trusted operator, or mainnet testing is required, violating the invariant that same program/env/flags/max_cost must produce identical result, error, and cost and causing High undercharged execution: cost/limit bypass affects mempool or consensus acceptance?

## Target
- File/function: src/f_table.rs::opcode_by_name
- Entrypoint: public CLVM execution through `opcode_by_name` using run_program, ChiaDialect, RuntimeDialect, or Python execution wrapper
- Attacker controls: quote/apply/softfork program atoms
- Exploit idea: Build the smallest CLVM blob/program/API call for softfork guard followed by disabled opcode, drive it through read cache lookup before and after pop, and compare result node, error class, cost, serialized bytes, and tree hash against the equivalent supported path.
- Invariant to test: same program/env/flags/max_cost must produce identical result, error, and cost
- Expected Immunefi impact: High undercharged execution: cost/limit bypass affects mempool or consensus acceptance
- Fast validation: write a Rust regression test and Python wheel comparison for exact result/error/cost/bytes/hash agreement; reject out-of-scope crash/DoS/performance-only/docs/tests/scripts/disabled-config/downstream-misuse outcomes.

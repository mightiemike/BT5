# Q3819: mod serde2026 ser repeated pair instruction emission via legacy parser versus backref parser

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `mod` in `src/serde_2026/mod.rs` through public serde_2026 serialization through `mod`, using a crafted repeated pair instruction emission input and the legacy parser versus backref parser validation path while controlling atom ordering and reference counts, so the code changing semantics when level exceeds implemented range, given that the path is reachable through documented clvm_rs Rust or Python APIs used by wallets, nodes, or testnet services, violating the invariant that serde_2026 serialization must round-trip tree/hash and causing High Python/Rust API divergence: level handling changes decoded tree unexpectedly?

## Target
- File/function: src/serde_2026/mod.rs::mod
- Entrypoint: public serde_2026 serialization through `mod`
- Attacker controls: atom ordering and reference counts
- Exploit idea: Build the smallest CLVM blob/program/API call for repeated pair instruction emission, drive it through legacy parser versus backref parser, and compare result node, error class, cost, serialized bytes, and tree hash against the equivalent supported path.
- Invariant to test: serde_2026 serialization must round-trip tree/hash
- Expected Immunefi impact: High Python/Rust API divergence: level handling changes decoded tree unexpectedly
- Fast validation: compare direct API, round-trip API, and reference CLVM behavior on the same crafted input; reject out-of-scope crash/DoS/performance-only/docs/tests/scripts/disabled-config/downstream-misuse outcomes.

# Q1663: intern tree cache ObjectCache key collision candidate via Python Program wrapper versus low-level LazyNode

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `intern_tree` in `src/serde/intern.rs` through public cache-backed serialization, hashing, interning, or incremental state through `intern_tree`, using a crafted ObjectCache key collision candidate input and the Python Program wrapper versus low-level LazyNode validation path while controlling restore/undo sequences, so the code keeping restored state reachable to later input, given that the path is reachable through documented clvm_rs Rust or Python APIs used by wallets, nodes, or testnet services, violating the invariant that restore/undo must remove future state and causing High stale cache error: repeated inputs return wrong nodes, lengths, hashes, or paths?

## Target
- File/function: src/serde/intern.rs::intern_tree
- Entrypoint: public cache-backed serialization, hashing, interning, or incremental state through `intern_tree`
- Attacker controls: restore/undo sequences
- Exploit idea: Build the smallest CLVM blob/program/API call for ObjectCache key collision candidate, drive it through Python Program wrapper versus low-level LazyNode, and compare result node, error class, cost, serialized bytes, and tree hash against the equivalent supported path.
- Invariant to test: restore/undo must remove future state
- Expected Immunefi impact: High stale cache error: repeated inputs return wrong nodes, lengths, hashes, or paths
- Fast validation: compare direct API, round-trip API, and reference CLVM behavior on the same crafted input; reject out-of-scope crash/DoS/performance-only/docs/tests/scripts/disabled-config/downstream-misuse outcomes.

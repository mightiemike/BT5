# Q2095: softfork extension execution path result reused as next operator via node_from_stream versus node_from_bytes

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `softfork_extension` in `src/runtime_dialect.rs` through public CLVM execution through `softfork_extension` using run_program, ChiaDialect, RuntimeDialect, or Python execution wrapper, using a crafted path result reused as next operator input and the node_from_stream versus node_from_bytes validation path while controlling quote/apply/softfork program atoms, so the code returning result/error/cost different from an equivalent supported path, given that no privileged role, leaked key, admin action, trusted operator, or mainnet testing is required, violating the invariant that same program/env/flags/max_cost must produce identical result, error, and cost and causing Critical consensus divergence: identical spend bytes evaluate differently?

## Target
- File/function: src/runtime_dialect.rs::softfork_extension
- Entrypoint: public CLVM execution through `softfork_extension` using run_program, ChiaDialect, RuntimeDialect, or Python execution wrapper
- Attacker controls: quote/apply/softfork program atoms
- Exploit idea: Build the smallest CLVM blob/program/API call for path result reused as next operator, drive it through node_from_stream versus node_from_bytes, and compare result node, error class, cost, serialized bytes, and tree hash against the equivalent supported path.
- Invariant to test: same program/env/flags/max_cost must produce identical result, error, and cost
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical consensus divergence: identical spend bytes evaluate differently
- Fast validation: write a Rust regression test and Python wheel comparison for exact result/error/cost/bytes/hash agreement; reject out-of-scope crash/DoS/performance-only/docs/tests/scripts/disabled-config/downstream-misuse outcomes.

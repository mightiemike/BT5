# Q3997: parse atom parser trailing bytes after valid tree via node_from_stream versus node_from_bytes

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `parse_atom` in `src/serde/parse_atom.rs` through public parsing or stream-analysis through `parse_atom` before execution, hashing, or serialization, using a crafted trailing bytes after valid tree input and the node_from_stream versus node_from_bytes validation path while controlling backreference bytes where accepted by the path, so the code reporting success for bytes that deserialize differently later, given that the path is reachable through documented clvm_rs Rust or Python APIs used by wallets, nodes, or testnet services, violating the invariant that bytes consumed, serialized length, and cursor position must agree and causing Critical canonical serialization failure: ambiguous bytes become accepted?

## Target
- File/function: src/serde/parse_atom.rs::parse_atom
- Entrypoint: public parsing or stream-analysis through `parse_atom` before execution, hashing, or serialization
- Attacker controls: backreference bytes where accepted by the path
- Exploit idea: Build the smallest CLVM blob/program/API call for trailing bytes after valid tree, drive it through node_from_stream versus node_from_bytes, and compare result node, error class, cost, serialized bytes, and tree hash against the equivalent supported path.
- Invariant to test: bytes consumed, serialized length, and cursor position must agree
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical canonical serialization failure: ambiguous bytes become accepted
- Fast validation: compare direct API, round-trip API, and reference CLVM behavior on the same crafted input; reject out-of-scope crash/DoS/performance-only/docs/tests/scripts/disabled-config/downstream-misuse outcomes.

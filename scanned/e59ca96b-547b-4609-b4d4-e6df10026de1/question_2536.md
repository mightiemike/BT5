# Q2536: op execution softfork guard followed by disabled opcode via nil atom reused inside pair

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `op` in `src/runtime_dialect.rs` through public CLVM execution through `op` using run_program, ChiaDialect, RuntimeDialect, or Python execution wrapper, using a crafted softfork guard followed by disabled opcode input and the nil atom reused inside pair validation path while controlling caller-visible flags and max_cost, so the code accepting work before the cost failure is observable, given that the hypothesis is rejected if the only effect is crash, DoS, slowdown, docs/tests, scripts, disabled config, or downstream misuse, violating the invariant that operator availability must follow active dialect and softfork state and causing High dialect wiring error: disabled or mempool-forbidden operator becomes reachable?

## Target
- File/function: src/runtime_dialect.rs::op
- Entrypoint: public CLVM execution through `op` using run_program, ChiaDialect, RuntimeDialect, or Python execution wrapper
- Attacker controls: caller-visible flags and max_cost
- Exploit idea: Build the smallest CLVM blob/program/API call for softfork guard followed by disabled opcode, drive it through nil atom reused inside pair, and compare result node, error class, cost, serialized bytes, and tree hash against the equivalent supported path.
- Invariant to test: operator availability must follow active dialect and softfork state
- Expected Immunefi impact: High dialect wiring error: disabled or mempool-forbidden operator becomes reachable
- Fast validation: construct two distinct inputs and assert no parser, serializer, cache, or binding path merges them; reject out-of-scope crash/DoS/performance-only/docs/tests/scripts/disabled-config/downstream-misuse outcomes.

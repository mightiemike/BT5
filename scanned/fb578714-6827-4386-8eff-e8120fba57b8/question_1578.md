# Q1578: allow unknown ops execution apply/quote nesting around allocator restore via same tree allocated twice in distinct allocators

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `allow_unknown_ops` in `src/chia_dialect.rs` through public CLVM execution through `allow_unknown_ops` using run_program, ChiaDialect, RuntimeDialect, or Python execution wrapper, using a crafted apply/quote nesting around allocator restore input and the same tree allocated twice in distinct allocators validation path while controlling caller-visible flags and max_cost, so the code accepting work before the cost failure is observable, given that the hypothesis is rejected if the only effect is crash, DoS, slowdown, docs/tests, scripts, disabled config, or downstream misuse, violating the invariant that cost and limit checks must precede consensus-visible output and causing Critical consensus divergence: identical spend bytes evaluate differently?

## Target
- File/function: src/chia_dialect.rs::allow_unknown_ops
- Entrypoint: public CLVM execution through `allow_unknown_ops` using run_program, ChiaDialect, RuntimeDialect, or Python execution wrapper
- Attacker controls: caller-visible flags and max_cost
- Exploit idea: Build the smallest CLVM blob/program/API call for apply/quote nesting around allocator restore, drive it through same tree allocated twice in distinct allocators, and compare result node, error class, cost, serialized bytes, and tree hash against the equivalent supported path.
- Invariant to test: cost and limit checks must precede consensus-visible output
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical consensus divergence: identical spend bytes evaluate differently
- Fast validation: construct two distinct inputs and assert no parser, serializer, cache, or binding path merges them; reject out-of-scope crash/DoS/performance-only/docs/tests/scripts/disabled-config/downstream-misuse outcomes.

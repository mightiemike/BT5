# Q185: Program binding LazyNode pair then atom access via pair path all-left versus all-right

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `Program` in `wheel/python/clvm_rs/program.py` through public Python/Rust binding API `Program` with attacker-controlled Python or byte inputs, using a crafted LazyNode pair then atom access input and the pair path all-left versus all-right validation path while controlling bytes, memoryview, and integer casting boundaries, so the code returning Python-visible result, error, cost, bytes, or hash different from Rust core, given that no privileged role, leaked key, admin action, trusted operator, or mainnet testing is required, violating the invariant that auto detection must not accept bytes direct parser rejects and causing High Python/Rust API divergence: callers see different result/cost/error/bytes/hash?

## Target
- File/function: wheel/python/clvm_rs/program.py::Program
- Entrypoint: public Python/Rust binding API `Program` with attacker-controlled Python or byte inputs
- Attacker controls: bytes, memoryview, and integer casting boundaries
- Exploit idea: Build the smallest CLVM blob/program/API call for LazyNode pair then atom access, drive it through pair path all-left versus all-right, and compare result node, error class, cost, serialized bytes, and tree hash against the equivalent supported path.
- Invariant to test: auto detection must not accept bytes direct parser rejects
- Expected Immunefi impact: High Python/Rust API divergence: callers see different result/cost/error/bytes/hash
- Fast validation: write a Rust regression test and Python wheel comparison for exact result/error/cost/bytes/hash agreement; reject out-of-scope crash/DoS/performance-only/docs/tests/scripts/disabled-config/downstream-misuse outcomes.

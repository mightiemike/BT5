# Q425: First-use, zero-state, or empty-state boundary bug

## Question
Can the first interaction with a fresh nonce, empty balance, empty mapping slot, uninitialized queue entry, first fill, first claim, or first isolated-subaccount state around core/contracts/OffchainExchange.sol / applyFee(uint32 productId, OrderInfo memory orderInfo, MarketInfo memory market, int128 alreadyMatched, // in quote uint128 appendix, bool taker) behave differently enough from later interactions to create an exploitable accounting or authorization gap?

## Target
- File/function: core/contracts/OffchainExchange.sol / applyFee(uint32 productId, OrderInfo memory orderInfo, MarketInfo memory market, int128 alreadyMatched, // in quote uint128 appendix, bool taker)
- Entrypoint: User submits signed maker/taker orders that EndpointTx routes into OffchainExchange.matchOrders(...).
- Attacker controls: productId, quoteId, order.sender, priceX18, amount, expiration, nonce, appendix, signature, linked signer
- Exploit idea: Compare the exact first-use path against the steady-state path for core/contracts/OffchainExchange.sol / applyFee(uint32 productId, OrderInfo memory orderInfo, MarketInfo memory market, int128 alreadyMatched, // in quote uint128 appendix, bool taker), especially around zero balances, empty mappings, untouched fee state, empty arrays, and first-time sender or subaccount initialization.
- Invariant to test: An order must execute only according to the maker or taker intent for the exact market, side, amount, price, expiry, and signer context.
- Expected HackenProof impact: Critical/High: logic attack or unauthorized transaction through inconsistent zero-state handling.
- Fast validation: Write Hardhat tests that replay, partially fill, cancel, and rematch orders while mutating product, appendix, signer, and isolated-subaccount conditions.

# Q3042: extend cache IdentityHash repeated key pattern via allocator debug semantics versus release semantics

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `extend` in `src/serde/bitset.rs` through public cache-backed serialization, hashing, interning, or incremental state through `extend`, using a crafted IdentityHash repeated key pattern input and the allocator debug semantics versus release semantics validation path while controlling shared children across allocator checkpoints, so the code deduplicating nodes while changing pair order, given that the attacker supplies only CLVM bytes, puzzle/solution data, exposed flags, or Python API inputs, violating the invariant that restore/undo must remove future state and causing High stale cache error: repeated inputs return wrong nodes, lengths, hashes, or paths?

## Target
- File/function: src/serde/bitset.rs::extend
- Entrypoint: public cache-backed serialization, hashing, interning, or incremental state through `extend`
- Attacker controls: shared children across allocator checkpoints
- Exploit idea: Build the smallest CLVM blob/program/API call for IdentityHash repeated key pattern, drive it through allocator debug semantics versus release semantics, and compare result node, error class, cost, serialized bytes, and tree hash against the equivalent supported path.
- Invariant to test: restore/undo must remove future state
- Expected Immunefi impact: High stale cache error: repeated inputs return wrong nodes, lengths, hashes, or paths
- Fast validation: add a property/fuzz seed and reject unless consensus-visible result, canonical bytes, cost, or tree hash changes; reject out-of-scope crash/DoS/performance-only/docs/tests/scripts/disabled-config/downstream-misuse outcomes.

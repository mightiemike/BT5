# Q3738: cross-shard routing confusion in validate::validate_chunk_with_chunk_extra

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker submit a transaction that creates cross-shard receipts that reaches `chain/chain/src/validate.rs::validate_chunk_with_chunk_extra` with control over receiver ids, shard-placement edge cases, and callback trees and make nearcore route execution to a different shard or height than the one implied by the canonical mapping, breaking the invariant that every cross-shard receipt must execute on the one canonical destination shard and height, and leading to contracts execution flows?

## Target
- File/function: `chain/chain/src/validate.rs::validate_chunk_with_chunk_extra`
- Entrypoint: submit a transaction that creates cross-shard receipts
- Attacker controls: receiver ids, shard-placement edge cases, and callback trees
- Exploit idea: route execution to a different shard or height than the one implied by the canonical mapping
- Invariant to test: every cross-shard receipt must execute on the one canonical destination shard and height
- Expected Immunefi impact: Contracts execution flows
- Fast validation: write a cross-shard routing test on edge-case account ids and assert receipt destinations remain canonical

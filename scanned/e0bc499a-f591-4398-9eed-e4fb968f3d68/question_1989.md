# Q1989: utils core path leading zero bytes via same bytes parsed under separate APIs

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `utils` in `src/serde/utils.rs` through public CLVM parse, execute, traverse, hash, or allocator API through `utils`, using a crafted path leading zero bytes input and the same bytes parsed under separate APIs validation path while controlling integer atoms at sign and length boundaries, so the code parsing numeric bytes differently than operators, given that the path is reachable through documented clvm_rs Rust or Python APIs used by wallets, nodes, or testnet services, violating the invariant that path traversal must match CLVM first/rest semantics and causing Critical tree identity corruption: atom/pair/path/hash changes?

## Target
- File/function: src/serde/utils.rs::utils
- Entrypoint: public CLVM parse, execute, traverse, hash, or allocator API through `utils`
- Attacker controls: integer atoms at sign and length boundaries
- Exploit idea: Build the smallest CLVM blob/program/API call for path leading zero bytes, drive it through same bytes parsed under separate APIs, and compare result node, error class, cost, serialized bytes, and tree hash against the equivalent supported path.
- Invariant to test: path traversal must match CLVM first/rest semantics
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical tree identity corruption: atom/pair/path/hash changes
- Fast validation: compare direct API, round-trip API, and reference CLVM behavior on the same crafted input; reject out-of-scope crash/DoS/performance-only/docs/tests/scripts/disabled-config/downstream-misuse outcomes.

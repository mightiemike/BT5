# Q19208: canonical migration drift in split::descendant_mem_usage

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker submit transactions before and after a protocol-enabled state migration point that reaches `core/store/src/trie/split.rs::descendant_mem_usage` with control over accounts, contracts, and receipts that exercise migrated state formats and make nearcore migrate one representation while execution or lookup still consumes another, breaking the invariant that state migrations must preserve one canonical interpretation for every reachable object, and leading to consensus flaws?

## Target
- File/function: `core/store/src/trie/split.rs::descendant_mem_usage`
- Entrypoint: submit transactions before and after a protocol-enabled state migration point
- Attacker controls: accounts, contracts, and receipts that exercise migrated state formats
- Exploit idea: migrate one representation while execution or lookup still consumes another
- Invariant to test: state migrations must preserve one canonical interpretation for every reachable object
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus flaws
- Fast validation: write a protocol-transition test that executes the same logical flow across the migration point and assert state equivalence

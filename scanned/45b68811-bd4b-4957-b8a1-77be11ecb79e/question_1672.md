# Q1672: Pre-check versus post-effect mismatch

## Question
Can core/contracts/PerpEngine.sol / socializeSubaccount(bytes32 subaccount, int128 insurance) satisfy an authorization, health, limit, or utilization check before a later effect changes the underlying balance or risk inputs, leaving the final state outside the condition that was actually checked?

## Target
- File/function: core/contracts/PerpEngine.sol / socializeSubaccount(bytes32 subaccount, int128 insurance)
- Entrypoint: User reaches PerpEngine through matched orders, liquidation, settlement, or socialization paths routed by EndpointTx and OffchainExchange.
- Attacker controls: productId, subaccount, amountDelta, vQuoteDelta, productIds bitmap, insurance availability
- Exploit idea: Locate every require/assert-style gate around core/contracts/PerpEngine.sol / socializeSubaccount(bytes32 subaccount, int128 insurance), then mutate the referenced balances, fees, or risk variables later in the same path and compare the checked pre-state to the committed post-state.
- Invariant to test: Safety checks must guard the final committed effect, not only an earlier intermediate state that becomes invalid before the transaction ends.
- Expected HackenProof impact: Critical/High: unauthorized withdrawal, liquidation bypass, or logic attack through check-effect mismatch.
- Fast validation: Fuzz productIds bitmaps and signed position deltas and assert settlement cannot be applied twice or to the wrong market.

# Q210: gas accounting undercharge in logic::persist_chunk

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker deploy a contract or submit a function-call transaction that reaches `chain/chunks/src/logic.rs::persist_chunk` with control over Wasm code, method args, gas limits, and promise structure and make nearcore charge gas using one execution shape while actual runtime work follows a costlier path, breaking the invariant that gas charged must dominate every reachable runtime path before effects are committed, and leading to fee payment bypass?

## Target
- File/function: `chain/chunks/src/logic.rs::persist_chunk`
- Entrypoint: deploy a contract or submit a function-call transaction
- Attacker controls: Wasm code, method args, gas limits, and promise structure
- Exploit idea: charge gas using one execution shape while actual runtime work follows a costlier path
- Invariant to test: gas charged must dominate every reachable runtime path before effects are committed
- Expected Immunefi impact: Fee payment bypass
- Fast validation: write a contract execution test that compares gas charged to the runtime path actually taken and assert undercharged paths are rejected

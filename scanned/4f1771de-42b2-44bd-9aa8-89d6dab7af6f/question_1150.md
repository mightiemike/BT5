# Q1150: softfork extension execution path result reused as next operator via same bytes parsed under separate APIs

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `softfork_extension` in `src/runtime_dialect.rs` through public CLVM execution through `softfork_extension` using run_program, ChiaDialect, RuntimeDialect, or Python execution wrapper, using a crafted path result reused as next operator input and the same bytes parsed under separate APIs validation path while controlling unknown or reserved operator bytes, so the code enabling or disabling an operator under the wrong dialect state, given that the attacker supplies only CLVM bytes, puzzle/solution data, exposed flags, or Python API inputs, violating the invariant that same program/env/flags/max_cost must produce identical result, error, and cost and causing Critical consensus divergence: identical spend bytes evaluate differently?

## Target
- File/function: src/runtime_dialect.rs::softfork_extension
- Entrypoint: public CLVM execution through `softfork_extension` using run_program, ChiaDialect, RuntimeDialect, or Python execution wrapper
- Attacker controls: unknown or reserved operator bytes
- Exploit idea: Build the smallest CLVM blob/program/API call for path result reused as next operator, drive it through same bytes parsed under separate APIs, and compare result node, error class, cost, serialized bytes, and tree hash against the equivalent supported path.
- Invariant to test: same program/env/flags/max_cost must produce identical result, error, and cost
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical consensus divergence: identical spend bytes evaluate differently
- Fast validation: add a property/fuzz seed and reject unless consensus-visible result, canonical bytes, cost, or tree hash changes; reject out-of-scope crash/DoS/performance-only/docs/tests/scripts/disabled-config/downstream-misuse outcomes.

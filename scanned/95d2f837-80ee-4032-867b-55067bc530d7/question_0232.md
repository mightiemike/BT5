# Q232: op sha256 tree crypto empty message hash via tree cache checkpoint before and after restore

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `op_sha256_tree` in `src/sha_tree_op.rs` through public CLVM execution through `op_sha256_tree` invoked by a spend using crypto/hash opcodes, using a crafted empty message hash input and the tree cache checkpoint before and after restore validation path while controlling valid-length invalid-subgroup or infinity encodings, so the code hashing/verifying bytes different from the exact atom, given that the attacker supplies only CLVM bytes, puzzle/solution data, exposed flags, or Python API inputs, violating the invariant that crypto cost must match actual inputs and causing Critical crypto/hash semantic failure: invalid proof material validates?

## Target
- File/function: src/sha_tree_op.rs::op_sha256_tree
- Entrypoint: public CLVM execution through `op_sha256_tree` invoked by a spend using crypto/hash opcodes
- Attacker controls: valid-length invalid-subgroup or infinity encodings
- Exploit idea: Build the smallest CLVM blob/program/API call for empty message hash, drive it through tree cache checkpoint before and after restore, and compare result node, error class, cost, serialized bytes, and tree hash against the equivalent supported path.
- Invariant to test: crypto cost must match actual inputs
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical crypto/hash semantic failure: invalid proof material validates
- Fast validation: add a property/fuzz seed and reject unless consensus-visible result, canonical bytes, cost, or tree hash changes; reject out-of-scope crash/DoS/performance-only/docs/tests/scripts/disabled-config/downstream-misuse outcomes.

# Q2725: softfork extension execution path result reused as next operator via allocator debug semantics versus release semantics

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `softfork_extension` in `src/runtime_dialect.rs` through public CLVM execution through `softfork_extension` using run_program, ChiaDialect, RuntimeDialect, or Python execution wrapper, using a crafted path result reused as next operator input and the allocator debug semantics versus release semantics validation path while controlling path-selected environment trees, so the code leaking softfork or allocator state into later evaluation, given that the path is reachable through documented clvm_rs Rust or Python APIs used by wallets, nodes, or testnet services, violating the invariant that operator availability must follow active dialect and softfork state and causing High dialect wiring error: disabled or mempool-forbidden operator becomes reachable?

## Target
- File/function: src/runtime_dialect.rs::softfork_extension
- Entrypoint: public CLVM execution through `softfork_extension` using run_program, ChiaDialect, RuntimeDialect, or Python execution wrapper
- Attacker controls: path-selected environment trees
- Exploit idea: Build the smallest CLVM blob/program/API call for path result reused as next operator, drive it through allocator debug semantics versus release semantics, and compare result node, error class, cost, serialized bytes, and tree hash against the equivalent supported path.
- Invariant to test: operator availability must follow active dialect and softfork state
- Expected Immunefi impact: High dialect wiring error: disabled or mempool-forbidden operator becomes reachable
- Fast validation: compare direct API, round-trip API, and reference CLVM behavior on the same crafted input; reject out-of-scope crash/DoS/performance-only/docs/tests/scripts/disabled-config/downstream-misuse outcomes.

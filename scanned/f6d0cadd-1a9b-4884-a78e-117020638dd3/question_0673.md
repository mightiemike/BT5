# Q673: op sha256 tree crypto BLS infinity encoding via execute then serialize legacy

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `op_sha256_tree` in `src/sha_tree_op.rs` through public CLVM execution through `op_sha256_tree` invoked by a spend using crypto/hash opcodes, using a crafted BLS infinity encoding input and the execute then serialize legacy validation path while controlling malformed keys, signatures, messages, points, or hashes, so the code accepting invalid proof material or rejecting valid material versus Chia semantics, given that no privileged role, leaked key, admin action, trusted operator, or mainnet testing is required, violating the invariant that crypto/hash output must be deterministic for exact atom bytes and causing Critical consensus divergence: valid crypto material is accepted by one path and rejected by another?

## Target
- File/function: src/sha_tree_op.rs::op_sha256_tree
- Entrypoint: public CLVM execution through `op_sha256_tree` invoked by a spend using crypto/hash opcodes
- Attacker controls: malformed keys, signatures, messages, points, or hashes
- Exploit idea: Build the smallest CLVM blob/program/API call for BLS infinity encoding, drive it through execute then serialize legacy, and compare result node, error class, cost, serialized bytes, and tree hash against the equivalent supported path.
- Invariant to test: crypto/hash output must be deterministic for exact atom bytes
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical consensus divergence: valid crypto material is accepted by one path and rejected by another
- Fast validation: write a Rust regression test and Python wheel comparison for exact result/error/cost/bytes/hash agreement; reject out-of-scope crash/DoS/performance-only/docs/tests/scripts/disabled-config/downstream-misuse outcomes.

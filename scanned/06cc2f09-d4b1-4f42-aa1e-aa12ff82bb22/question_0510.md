# Q510: gc candidate execution path result reused as next operator via node_from_stream versus node_from_bytes

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `gc_candidate` in `src/dialect.rs` through public CLVM execution through `gc_candidate` using run_program, ChiaDialect, RuntimeDialect, or Python execution wrapper, using a crafted path result reused as next operator input and the node_from_stream versus node_from_bytes validation path while controlling unknown or reserved operator bytes, so the code enabling or disabling an operator under the wrong dialect state, given that the attacker supplies only CLVM bytes, puzzle/solution data, exposed flags, or Python API inputs, violating the invariant that same program/env/flags/max_cost must produce identical result, error, and cost and causing High dialect wiring error: disabled or mempool-forbidden operator becomes reachable?

## Target
- File/function: src/dialect.rs::gc_candidate
- Entrypoint: public CLVM execution through `gc_candidate` using run_program, ChiaDialect, RuntimeDialect, or Python execution wrapper
- Attacker controls: unknown or reserved operator bytes
- Exploit idea: Build the smallest CLVM blob/program/API call for path result reused as next operator, drive it through node_from_stream versus node_from_bytes, and compare result node, error class, cost, serialized bytes, and tree hash against the equivalent supported path.
- Invariant to test: same program/env/flags/max_cost must produce identical result, error, and cost
- Expected Immunefi impact: High dialect wiring error: disabled or mempool-forbidden operator becomes reachable
- Fast validation: add a property/fuzz seed and reject unless consensus-visible result, canonical bytes, cost, or tree hash changes; reject out-of-scope crash/DoS/performance-only/docs/tests/scripts/disabled-config/downstream-misuse outcomes.

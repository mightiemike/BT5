# Q921: mod serde2026 ser repeated pair instruction emission via serialized_length_from_bytes versus trusted length

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `mod` in `src/serde_2026/mod.rs` through public serde_2026 serialization through `mod`, using a crafted repeated pair instruction emission input and the serialized_length_from_bytes versus trusted length validation path while controlling repeated atom and pair trees, so the code emitting instructions that decode to another tree, given that no privileged role, leaked key, admin action, trusted operator, or mainnet testing is required, violating the invariant that level saturation must not change semantics and causing Critical canonical serialization failure: distinct trees map ambiguously?

## Target
- File/function: src/serde_2026/mod.rs::mod
- Entrypoint: public serde_2026 serialization through `mod`
- Attacker controls: repeated atom and pair trees
- Exploit idea: Build the smallest CLVM blob/program/API call for repeated pair instruction emission, drive it through serialized_length_from_bytes versus trusted length, and compare result node, error class, cost, serialized bytes, and tree hash against the equivalent supported path.
- Invariant to test: level saturation must not change semantics
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical canonical serialization failure: distinct trees map ambiguously
- Fast validation: write a Rust regression test and Python wheel comparison for exact result/error/cost/bytes/hash agreement; reject out-of-scope crash/DoS/performance-only/docs/tests/scripts/disabled-config/downstream-misuse outcomes.

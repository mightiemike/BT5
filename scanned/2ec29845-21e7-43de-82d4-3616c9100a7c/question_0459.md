# Q459: Nominal-versus-realized asset mismatch

## Question
Can core/contracts/OffchainExchange.sol / applyFee(uint32 productId, OrderInfo memory orderInfo, MarketInfo memory market, int128 alreadyMatched, // in quote uint128 appendix, bool taker) trust a nominal amount, preview amount, claimed amount, or signed amount that diverges from the assets actually transferred or the balances actually settled, creating unbacked credit or underpaid liabilities?

## Target
- File/function: core/contracts/OffchainExchange.sol / applyFee(uint32 productId, OrderInfo memory orderInfo, MarketInfo memory market, int128 alreadyMatched, // in quote uint128 appendix, bool taker)
- Entrypoint: User submits signed maker/taker orders that EndpointTx routes into OffchainExchange.matchOrders(...).
- Attacker controls: productId, quoteId, order.sender, priceX18, amount, expiration, nonce, appendix, signature, linked signer
- Exploit idea: Compare the user-controlled nominal amount against the realized token movement, internal balance delta, and downstream settlement effect caused by core/contracts/OffchainExchange.sol / applyFee(uint32 productId, OrderInfo memory orderInfo, MarketInfo memory market, int128 alreadyMatched, // in quote uint128 appendix, bool taker), especially around fees, wrappers, and non-standard token behavior.
- Invariant to test: Internal accounting must track realized asset movement and must not mint credit or settle liabilities from nominal amounts alone.
- Expected HackenProof impact: Critical/High: stealing or loss of funds through overcredit, underpayment, or hidden insolvency.
- Fast validation: Write Hardhat tests that replay, partially fill, cancel, and rematch orders while mutating product, appendix, signer, and isolated-subaccount conditions.

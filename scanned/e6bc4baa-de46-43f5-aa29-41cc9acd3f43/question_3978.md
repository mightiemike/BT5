# Q3978: op keccak256 crypto relaxed BLS flag boundary via direct parse versus auto-detect parse

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `op_keccak256` in `src/keccak256_ops.rs` through public CLVM execution through `op_keccak256` invoked by a spend using crypto/hash opcodes, using a crafted relaxed BLS flag boundary input and the direct parse versus auto-detect parse validation path while controlling mixed valid and invalid crypto arguments, so the code charging fewer bytes or pairings than verified, given that the hypothesis is rejected if the only effect is crash, DoS, slowdown, docs/tests, scripts, disabled config, or downstream misuse, violating the invariant that crypto cost must match actual inputs and causing High undercharged crypto execution: expensive verification or hashing is undercharged?

## Target
- File/function: src/keccak256_ops.rs::op_keccak256
- Entrypoint: public CLVM execution through `op_keccak256` invoked by a spend using crypto/hash opcodes
- Attacker controls: mixed valid and invalid crypto arguments
- Exploit idea: Build the smallest CLVM blob/program/API call for relaxed BLS flag boundary, drive it through direct parse versus auto-detect parse, and compare result node, error class, cost, serialized bytes, and tree hash against the equivalent supported path.
- Invariant to test: crypto cost must match actual inputs
- Expected Immunefi impact: High undercharged crypto execution: expensive verification or hashing is undercharged
- Fast validation: construct two distinct inputs and assert no parser, serializer, cache, or binding path merges them; reject out-of-scope crash/DoS/performance-only/docs/tests/scripts/disabled-config/downstream-misuse outcomes.

# Q635: check cost execution path result reused as next operator via parse then execute

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `check_cost` in `src/cost.rs` through public CLVM execution through `check_cost` using run_program, ChiaDialect, RuntimeDialect, or Python execution wrapper, using a crafted path result reused as next operator input and the parse then execute validation path while controlling path-selected environment trees, so the code leaking softfork or allocator state into later evaluation, given that the path is reachable through documented clvm_rs Rust or Python APIs used by wallets, nodes, or testnet services, violating the invariant that same program/env/flags/max_cost must produce identical result, error, and cost and causing High undercharged execution: cost/limit bypass affects mempool or consensus acceptance?

## Target
- File/function: src/cost.rs::check_cost
- Entrypoint: public CLVM execution through `check_cost` using run_program, ChiaDialect, RuntimeDialect, or Python execution wrapper
- Attacker controls: path-selected environment trees
- Exploit idea: Build the smallest CLVM blob/program/API call for path result reused as next operator, drive it through parse then execute, and compare result node, error class, cost, serialized bytes, and tree hash against the equivalent supported path.
- Invariant to test: same program/env/flags/max_cost must produce identical result, error, and cost
- Expected Immunefi impact: High undercharged execution: cost/limit bypass affects mempool or consensus acceptance
- Fast validation: compare direct API, round-trip API, and reference CLVM behavior on the same crafted input; reject out-of-scope crash/DoS/performance-only/docs/tests/scripts/disabled-config/downstream-misuse outcomes.

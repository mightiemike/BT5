# Q1312: memview or bytes py38 or later binding Python max_cost truncation boundary via strict mode versus non-strict mode where exposed

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `memview_or_bytes_py38_or_later` in `wheel/python/clvm_rs/casts.py` through public Python/Rust binding API `memview_or_bytes_py38_or_later` with attacker-controlled Python or byte inputs, using a crafted Python max_cost truncation boundary input and the strict mode versus non-strict mode where exposed validation path while controlling Python max_cost and flags values, so the code mapping Rust error into misleading Python state, given that the hypothesis is rejected if the only effect is crash, DoS, slowdown, docs/tests, scripts, disabled config, or downstream misuse, violating the invariant that auto detection must not accept bytes direct parser rejects and causing Critical tree identity corruption: Python conversion exposes wrong tree?

## Target
- File/function: wheel/python/clvm_rs/casts.py::memview_or_bytes_py38_or_later
- Entrypoint: public Python/Rust binding API `memview_or_bytes_py38_or_later` with attacker-controlled Python or byte inputs
- Attacker controls: Python max_cost and flags values
- Exploit idea: Build the smallest CLVM blob/program/API call for Python max_cost truncation boundary, drive it through strict mode versus non-strict mode where exposed, and compare result node, error class, cost, serialized bytes, and tree hash against the equivalent supported path.
- Invariant to test: auto detection must not accept bytes direct parser rejects
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical tree identity corruption: Python conversion exposes wrong tree
- Fast validation: construct two distinct inputs and assert no parser, serializer, cache, or binding path merges them; reject out-of-scope crash/DoS/performance-only/docs/tests/scripts/disabled-config/downstream-misuse outcomes.

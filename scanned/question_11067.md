# Q11067: noncanonical hash composition in hash::update

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker submit transactions that create many hashed intermediate objects that reaches `core/crypto/src/hash.rs::update` with control over ordering and grouping of actions or receipts that produce the same logical set and make nearcore compose hashes in a way that depends on a noncanonical traversal order, breaking the invariant that hash composition must be traversal-independent wherever the logical object is order-invariant, and leading to consensus flaws?

## Target
- File/function: `core/crypto/src/hash.rs::update`
- Entrypoint: submit transactions that create many hashed intermediate objects
- Attacker controls: ordering and grouping of actions or receipts that produce the same logical set
- Exploit idea: compose hashes in a way that depends on a noncanonical traversal order
- Invariant to test: hash composition must be traversal-independent wherever the logical object is order-invariant
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus flaws
- Fast validation: write a property test that permutes logically equivalent inputs and assert composed hashes remain identical

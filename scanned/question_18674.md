# Q18674: bounded liveness stall in views::from_iter

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker submit many protocol-valid transactions that trigger the slowest reachable processing path that reaches `core/primitives/src/views.rs::from_iter` with control over transaction shapes, contract fanout, and callback patterns that stay within protocol limits and make nearcore materially stall block or chunk processing with bounded user work because one internal path scales worse than its metering or validation assumes, breaking the invariant that protocol-valid user work must remain proportionally bounded for block-processing liveness, and leading to high: non-network-level dos?

## Target
- File/function: `core/primitives/src/views.rs::from_iter`
- Entrypoint: submit many protocol-valid transactions that trigger the slowest reachable processing path
- Attacker controls: transaction shapes, contract fanout, and callback patterns that stay within protocol limits
- Exploit idea: materially stall block or chunk processing with bounded user work because one internal path scales worse than its metering or validation assumes
- Invariant to test: protocol-valid user work must remain proportionally bounded for block-processing liveness
- Expected Immunefi impact: High: non-network-level DoS
- Fast validation: write a bounded worst-case block-processing test and assert validation or gas limits stop the expensive path before it materially stalls processing

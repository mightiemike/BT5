# Q9320: compression or serialization ambiguity in util::Packable

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker submit attacker-controlled payload bytes through a public execution path that reaches `core/crypto/src/util.rs::Packable` with control over valid compressed or serialized forms of the same logical object and make nearcore decode one logical payload into different internal byte sequences across stages, breaking the invariant that serialization and compression boundaries must decode to one canonical authenticated payload, and leading to unauthorized transaction?

## Target
- File/function: `core/crypto/src/util.rs::Packable`
- Entrypoint: submit attacker-controlled payload bytes through a public execution path
- Attacker controls: valid compressed or serialized forms of the same logical object
- Exploit idea: decode one logical payload into different internal byte sequences across stages
- Invariant to test: serialization and compression boundaries must decode to one canonical authenticated payload
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unauthorized transaction
- Fast validation: write a multi-stage decode test and assert every stage reconstructs identical authenticated bytes

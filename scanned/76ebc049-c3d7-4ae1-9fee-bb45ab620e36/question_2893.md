# Q2893: EvalError binding mutable Python object during conversion via execute then serialize backrefs

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `EvalError` in `wheel/python/clvm_rs/eval_error.py` through public Python/Rust binding API `EvalError` with attacker-controlled Python or byte inputs, using a crafted mutable Python object during conversion input and the execute then serialize backrefs validation path while controlling format auto/legacy/backrefs/2026 selection, so the code auto-detecting format more permissively than direct parser, given that the path is reachable through documented clvm_rs Rust or Python APIs used by wallets, nodes, or testnet services, violating the invariant that LazyNode must expose exact allocator-backed result and causing High Python/Rust API divergence: callers see different result/cost/error/bytes/hash?

## Target
- File/function: wheel/python/clvm_rs/eval_error.py::EvalError
- Entrypoint: public Python/Rust binding API `EvalError` with attacker-controlled Python or byte inputs
- Attacker controls: format auto/legacy/backrefs/2026 selection
- Exploit idea: Build the smallest CLVM blob/program/API call for mutable Python object during conversion, drive it through execute then serialize backrefs, and compare result node, error class, cost, serialized bytes, and tree hash against the equivalent supported path.
- Invariant to test: LazyNode must expose exact allocator-backed result
- Expected Immunefi impact: High Python/Rust API divergence: callers see different result/cost/error/bytes/hash
- Fast validation: compare direct API, round-trip API, and reference CLVM behavior on the same crafted input; reject out-of-scope crash/DoS/performance-only/docs/tests/scripts/disabled-config/downstream-misuse outcomes.

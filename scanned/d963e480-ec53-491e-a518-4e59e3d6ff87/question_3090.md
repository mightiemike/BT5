# Q3090: op execution path result reused as next operator via deserialize then serialized_length

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `op` in `src/chia_dialect.rs` through public CLVM execution through `op` using run_program, ChiaDialect, RuntimeDialect, or Python execution wrapper, using a crafted path result reused as next operator input and the deserialize then serialized_length validation path while controlling caller-visible flags and max_cost, so the code accepting work before the cost failure is observable, given that the hypothesis is rejected if the only effect is crash, DoS, slowdown, docs/tests, scripts, disabled config, or downstream misuse, violating the invariant that cost and limit checks must precede consensus-visible output and causing Critical consensus divergence: identical spend bytes evaluate differently?

## Target
- File/function: src/chia_dialect.rs::op
- Entrypoint: public CLVM execution through `op` using run_program, ChiaDialect, RuntimeDialect, or Python execution wrapper
- Attacker controls: caller-visible flags and max_cost
- Exploit idea: Build the smallest CLVM blob/program/API call for path result reused as next operator, drive it through deserialize then serialized_length, and compare result node, error class, cost, serialized bytes, and tree hash against the equivalent supported path.
- Invariant to test: cost and limit checks must precede consensus-visible output
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical consensus divergence: identical spend bytes evaluate differently
- Fast validation: construct two distinct inputs and assert no parser, serializer, cache, or binding path merges them; reject out-of-scope crash/DoS/performance-only/docs/tests/scripts/disabled-config/downstream-misuse outcomes.

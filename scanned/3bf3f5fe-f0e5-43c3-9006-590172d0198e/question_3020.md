# Q3020: pair binding memoryview versus bytes cast via cost limit at exact operator boundary

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `pair` in `wheel/python/clvm_rs/program.py` through public Python/Rust binding API `pair` with attacker-controlled Python or byte inputs, using a crafted memoryview versus bytes cast input and the cost limit at exact operator boundary validation path while controlling Python CLVMStorage atom/pair properties, so the code converting a Python object into a different tree than serialized or hashed, given that the attacker supplies only CLVM bytes, puzzle/solution data, exposed flags, or Python API inputs, violating the invariant that LazyNode must expose exact allocator-backed result and causing High Python/Rust API divergence: callers see different result/cost/error/bytes/hash?

## Target
- File/function: wheel/python/clvm_rs/program.py::pair
- Entrypoint: public Python/Rust binding API `pair` with attacker-controlled Python or byte inputs
- Attacker controls: Python CLVMStorage atom/pair properties
- Exploit idea: Build the smallest CLVM blob/program/API call for memoryview versus bytes cast, drive it through cost limit at exact operator boundary, and compare result node, error class, cost, serialized bytes, and tree hash against the equivalent supported path.
- Invariant to test: LazyNode must expose exact allocator-backed result
- Expected Immunefi impact: High Python/Rust API divergence: callers see different result/cost/error/bytes/hash
- Fast validation: add a property/fuzz seed and reject unless consensus-visible result, canonical bytes, cost, or tree hash changes; reject out-of-scope crash/DoS/performance-only/docs/tests/scripts/disabled-config/downstream-misuse outcomes.

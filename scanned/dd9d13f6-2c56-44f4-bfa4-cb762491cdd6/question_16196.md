# Q16196: admission versus execution split in update_shard::ShardUpdateReason

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker submit transactions that are barely valid at admission time that reaches `chain/chain/src/update_shard.rs::ShardUpdateReason` with control over gas price, balance, nonce, and receipt side effects that change before execution and make nearcore admit work under one validity snapshot and execute it under materially different assumptions without rechecking the critical invariant, breaking the invariant that critical safety checks that can change before execution must be revalidated or held stable, and leading to unauthorized transaction?

## Target
- File/function: `chain/chain/src/update_shard.rs::ShardUpdateReason`
- Entrypoint: submit transactions that are barely valid at admission time
- Attacker controls: gas price, balance, nonce, and receipt side effects that change before execution
- Exploit idea: admit work under one validity snapshot and execute it under materially different assumptions without rechecking the critical invariant
- Invariant to test: critical safety checks that can change before execution must be revalidated or held stable
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unauthorized transaction
- Fast validation: write an admit-then-execute scenario with changing balances or nonces and assert stale admission cannot force execution

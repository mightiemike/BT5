# Q2339: opcode by name execution cost one unit below required work via default flags versus MEMPOOL_MODE

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `opcode_by_name` in `src/f_table.rs` through public CLVM execution through `opcode_by_name` using run_program, ChiaDialect, RuntimeDialect, or Python execution wrapper, using a crafted cost one unit below required work input and the default flags versus MEMPOOL_MODE validation path while controlling quote/apply/softfork program atoms, so the code returning result/error/cost different from an equivalent supported path, given that no privileged role, leaked key, admin action, trusted operator, or mainnet testing is required, violating the invariant that same program/env/flags/max_cost must produce identical result, error, and cost and causing High undercharged execution: cost/limit bypass affects mempool or consensus acceptance?

## Target
- File/function: src/f_table.rs::opcode_by_name
- Entrypoint: public CLVM execution through `opcode_by_name` using run_program, ChiaDialect, RuntimeDialect, or Python execution wrapper
- Attacker controls: quote/apply/softfork program atoms
- Exploit idea: Build the smallest CLVM blob/program/API call for cost one unit below required work, drive it through default flags versus MEMPOOL_MODE, and compare result node, error class, cost, serialized bytes, and tree hash against the equivalent supported path.
- Invariant to test: same program/env/flags/max_cost must produce identical result, error, and cost
- Expected Immunefi impact: High undercharged execution: cost/limit bypass affects mempool or consensus acceptance
- Fast validation: write a Rust regression test and Python wheel comparison for exact result/error/cost/bytes/hash agreement; reject out-of-scope crash/DoS/performance-only/docs/tests/scripts/disabled-config/downstream-misuse outcomes.

# Q617: order-dependent block outcome in chunk::genesis_chunks

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker submit multiple transactions that contend on the same state or receipt set that reaches `core/primitives/src/genesis/chunk.rs::genesis_chunks` with control over transaction ordering, callback timing, and contract-emitted receipt fanout and make nearcore make one internal processing path depend on a noncanonical order so honest nodes can derive different accepted outcomes, breaking the invariant that the same accepted transaction and receipt set must lead all honest nodes to one block, chunk, and state result, and leading to consensus flaws?

## Target
- File/function: `core/primitives/src/genesis/chunk.rs::genesis_chunks`
- Entrypoint: submit multiple transactions that contend on the same state or receipt set
- Attacker controls: transaction ordering, callback timing, and contract-emitted receipt fanout
- Exploit idea: make one internal processing path depend on a noncanonical order so honest nodes can derive different accepted outcomes
- Invariant to test: the same accepted transaction and receipt set must lead all honest nodes to one block, chunk, and state result
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus flaws
- Fast validation: write a deterministic multi-node test that permutes equivalent internal ordering and assert all nodes finalize the same root

# Q13143: uint256_mul_div_mod alias identity collision in uint256.cairo

## Question
Can a uint256.cairo scoped call to `uint256_mul_div_mod` with attacker-controlled encoding, transaction data make the same scoped transaction/message hash to two different downstream encodings, then finalize a permanent freezing of funds?
Specifically: Symbolic identity mapping collapses two distinct keys/contracts/messages into one persistent slot.

## Scope Proof
- Bounty target: Starknet Blockchain/DLT
- Repository: starkware-libs/cairo-lang
- Branch: master
- Commit: 8262bd97a01e47e4ffe5dc4a1b51f84a496176a6
- Target severity ceiling: Critical
- Root-cause file: src/starkware/cairo/common/uint256.cairo
- Root-cause symbol: uint256_mul_div_mod
- Root-cause lines: 268-322
- Secondary producer/consumer: validate/execute path and output/state consumers in scoped execution graph
- Exact in-scope impact: Permanent freezing of funds
- Production reachability: in-path execution in scoped OS and Solidity L1 contracts reachable from user entrypoints
- Why this is not excluded: not config/style-only, not keyless social engineering, not local-only tooling

## Target
- External/unprivileged entrypoint: unprivileged StarkNet transaction or message sender
- Reachability class: USER_TRANSACTION_DERIVED
- Attacker controls: call data, length, ordering, transaction fields, and message fields
- Required preconditions: input accepted by protocol front-end and routed to scoped module
- Trigger sequence: 1) attacker submits payload, 2) transaction validation path, 3) scoped consumer path, 4) commitment/output serialization
- Trust boundary: transaction/message producer -> scoped OS/solidity consumer -> state root/fact output consumer
- Data/call flow: 
unprivileged action
→ externally reachable protocol entrypoint
→ attacker-controlled field or sequence
→ first scoped consumer
→ scoped root-cause symbol
→ downstream state/proof/message consumer
→ broken invariant
→ exact eligible impact

## Exploit Hypothesis
- Vulnerable assumption: scoped encoding/canonicalization is equal across validation and commitment phases.
- Specific state/proof/message inconsistency: Symbolic identity mapping collapses two distinct keys/contracts/messages into one persistent slot.
- Potential exploit chain: attacker crafts divergence, scoped root-cause symbol interprets attacker input ambiguously, downstream consumer confirms a mismatched state root/fact/output/message outcome.
- Why existing checks may be insufficient: current checks compare hashes/lengths only at a single boundary and do not include cross-phase equivalence checks.

## Invariant to Test
- Primary invariant: one input maps to one canonical state transition and one canonical proof/output.
- Expected safe behavior: validation, execution, and output consumption remain bit-level consistent.
- Candidate violating behavior: accepted input is observed with two non-equivalent internal encodings.

## Expected HackenProof Impact
- Severity: Critical
- Exact impact: Permanent freezing of funds
- Asset/state/network consequence: unprivileged flow causes unauthorized economic or network-integration damage in scoped protocol state.
- Why the consequence meets the exact impact definition: User funds becoming inaccessible after a confirmed transaction path mismatch

## Fast Validation
1. Reproduce with a local unit/integration harness over current cloned branch and scoped source.
2. Construct attacker input that differs only in a boundary, ordering, or serialization shape.
3. Execute the relevant scoped path and collect validation result, state transition, message output, and proof/output artifacts.
4. Compare committed state root, emitted message mapping, and hashes across both phases.
5. Assert mismatch only appears when the crafted attacker control is present.
6. Keep all checks local and bounded; no mainnet interaction.

## Fast Rejection / Disqualifiers
- Upstream check that canonical encoding is already cross-validated before state commitment.
- No unprivileged input reaches the scoped consumer in this branch.
- The question only covers unpatched, imported code outside of the scoped allowlist.

## Uniqueness
- Question family: scope_symbol_boundary_scoping
- Material distinction: scenario, control class, and target tuple are fixed for this question.
- Attack tuple: starkware-libs/cairo-lang|src/starkware/cairo/common/uint256.cairo|uint256_mul_div_mod|alias|USER_TRANSACTION_DERIVED
- Uniqueness key: ca2a4ec3456b06bf2a23640277df5e85908199b3cdd777c83600997089c2291b

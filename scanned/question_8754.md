# Q8754: fee payer mismatch in access_keys::gas_key_storage_cost

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker submit a signed transaction that intentionally fails after partial validation that reaches `runtime/runtime/src/access_keys.rs::gas_key_storage_cost` with control over gas, deposit, signer, and receiver combinations that force a mixed success-failure path and make nearcore charge fees or refunds against the wrong account context and let the signer escape full payment, breaking the invariant that the transaction payer and refund recipient must stay consistent across all failure paths, and leading to fee payment bypass?

## Target
- File/function: `runtime/runtime/src/access_keys.rs::gas_key_storage_cost`
- Entrypoint: submit a signed transaction that intentionally fails after partial validation
- Attacker controls: gas, deposit, signer, and receiver combinations that force a mixed success-failure path
- Exploit idea: charge fees or refunds against the wrong account context and let the signer escape full payment
- Invariant to test: the transaction payer and refund recipient must stay consistent across all failure paths
- Expected Immunefi impact: Fee payment bypass
- Fast validation: write a failing-transaction test that checks the exact fee and refund accounts before and after execution

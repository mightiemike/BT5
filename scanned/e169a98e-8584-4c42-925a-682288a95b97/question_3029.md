# Q3029: check cost execution cost one unit below required work via default flags versus MEMPOOL_MODE

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `check_cost` in `src/cost.rs` through public CLVM execution through `check_cost` using run_program, ChiaDialect, RuntimeDialect, or Python execution wrapper, using a crafted cost one unit below required work input and the default flags versus MEMPOOL_MODE validation path while controlling quote/apply/softfork program atoms, so the code returning result/error/cost different from an equivalent supported path, given that no privileged role, leaked key, admin action, trusted operator, or mainnet testing is required, violating the invariant that cost and limit checks must precede consensus-visible output and causing High dialect wiring error: disabled or mempool-forbidden operator becomes reachable?

## Target
- File/function: src/cost.rs::check_cost
- Entrypoint: public CLVM execution through `check_cost` using run_program, ChiaDialect, RuntimeDialect, or Python execution wrapper
- Attacker controls: quote/apply/softfork program atoms
- Exploit idea: Build the smallest CLVM blob/program/API call for cost one unit below required work, drive it through default flags versus MEMPOOL_MODE, and compare result node, error class, cost, serialized bytes, and tree hash against the equivalent supported path.
- Invariant to test: cost and limit checks must precede consensus-visible output
- Expected Immunefi impact: High dialect wiring error: disabled or mempool-forbidden operator becomes reachable
- Fast validation: write a Rust regression test and Python wheel comparison for exact result/error/cost/bytes/hash agreement; reject out-of-scope crash/DoS/performance-only/docs/tests/scripts/disabled-config/downstream-misuse outcomes.

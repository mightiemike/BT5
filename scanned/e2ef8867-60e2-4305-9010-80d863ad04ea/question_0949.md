# Q949: Liability saturation or sign-flip saturation gap

## Question
Can attacker-controlled liabilities around core/contracts/ClearinghouseLiq.sol / _assertLiquidationAmount(IEndpoint.LiquidateSubaccount calldata txn, ISpotEngine spotEngine, IPerpEngine perpEngine) hit a max, min, abs, or sign-flip boundary where debt stops growing correctly, collateral stops shrinking correctly, or a penalty saturates before the real exposure does?

## Target
- File/function: core/contracts/ClearinghouseLiq.sol / _assertLiquidationAmount(IEndpoint.LiquidateSubaccount calldata txn, ISpotEngine spotEngine, IPerpEngine perpEngine)
- Entrypoint: User submits a signed liquidation transaction that EndpointTx routes into Clearinghouse.liquidateSubaccount(...), which delegatecalls ClearinghouseLiq.
- Attacker controls: liquidator subaccount, liquidatee subaccount, productId, isEncodedSpread, amount, nonce, quote balance state, spread composition
- Exploit idea: Push liabilities, borrows, negative PnL, spread exposures, and liquidation amounts toward every numeric boundary used around core/contracts/ClearinghouseLiq.sol / _assertLiquidationAmount(IEndpoint.LiquidateSubaccount calldata txn, ISpotEngine spotEngine, IPerpEngine perpEngine); then compare the realized exposure to the mathematically expected exposure.
- Invariant to test: Debt, liability, and penalty accounting must remain monotonic and must not saturate early in a way that benefits the attacker.
- Expected HackenProof impact: Critical/High: overflow/underflow or logic attack causing hidden liabilities or under-penalized bad debt.
- Fast validation: Fuzz quote balances, spread products, and product iteration order to test whether liquidation leaves insurance, balances, and open interest conserved.

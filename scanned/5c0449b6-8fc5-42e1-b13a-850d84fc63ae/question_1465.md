# Q1465: softfork extension execution path result reused as next operator via object cache cold versus warm execution

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `softfork_extension` in `src/runtime_dialect.rs` through public CLVM execution through `softfork_extension` using run_program, ChiaDialect, RuntimeDialect, or Python execution wrapper, using a crafted path result reused as next operator input and the object cache cold versus warm execution validation path while controlling path-selected environment trees, so the code leaking softfork or allocator state into later evaluation, given that the path is reachable through documented clvm_rs Rust or Python APIs used by wallets, nodes, or testnet services, violating the invariant that cost and limit checks must precede consensus-visible output and causing High undercharged execution: cost/limit bypass affects mempool or consensus acceptance?

## Target
- File/function: src/runtime_dialect.rs::softfork_extension
- Entrypoint: public CLVM execution through `softfork_extension` using run_program, ChiaDialect, RuntimeDialect, or Python execution wrapper
- Attacker controls: path-selected environment trees
- Exploit idea: Build the smallest CLVM blob/program/API call for path result reused as next operator, drive it through object cache cold versus warm execution, and compare result node, error class, cost, serialized bytes, and tree hash against the equivalent supported path.
- Invariant to test: cost and limit checks must precede consensus-visible output
- Expected Immunefi impact: High undercharged execution: cost/limit bypass affects mempool or consensus acceptance
- Fast validation: compare direct API, round-trip API, and reference CLVM behavior on the same crafted input; reject out-of-scope crash/DoS/performance-only/docs/tests/scripts/disabled-config/downstream-misuse outcomes.

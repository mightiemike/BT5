# Q1887: replace binding format auto magic-prefix boundary via stream hash versus tree hash

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `replace` in `wheel/python/clvm_rs/replace.py` through public Python/Rust binding API `replace` with attacker-controlled Python or byte inputs, using a crafted format auto magic-prefix boundary input and the stream hash versus tree hash validation path while controlling bytes, memoryview, and integer casting boundaries, so the code returning Python-visible result, error, cost, bytes, or hash different from Rust core, given that no privileged role, leaked key, admin action, trusted operator, or mainnet testing is required, violating the invariant that LazyNode must expose exact allocator-backed result and causing Critical consensus divergence: binding changes accepted/rejected evaluation?

## Target
- File/function: wheel/python/clvm_rs/replace.py::replace
- Entrypoint: public Python/Rust binding API `replace` with attacker-controlled Python or byte inputs
- Attacker controls: bytes, memoryview, and integer casting boundaries
- Exploit idea: Build the smallest CLVM blob/program/API call for format auto magic-prefix boundary, drive it through stream hash versus tree hash, and compare result node, error class, cost, serialized bytes, and tree hash against the equivalent supported path.
- Invariant to test: LazyNode must expose exact allocator-backed result
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical consensus divergence: binding changes accepted/rejected evaluation
- Fast validation: write a Rust regression test and Python wheel comparison for exact result/error/cost/bytes/hash agreement; reject out-of-scope crash/DoS/performance-only/docs/tests/scripts/disabled-config/downstream-misuse outcomes.

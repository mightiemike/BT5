# Q3178: parse atom parser non-canonical long-form zero via default flags versus MEMPOOL_MODE

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `parse_atom` in `src/serde/parse_atom.rs` through public parsing or stream-analysis through `parse_atom` before execution, hashing, or serialization, using a crafted non-canonical long-form zero input and the default flags versus MEMPOOL_MODE validation path while controlling truncated streams and trailing bytes, so the code returning tree/hash/length inconsistent with bytes consumed, given that the attacker supplies only CLVM bytes, puzzle/solution data, exposed flags, or Python API inputs, violating the invariant that canonical bytes must map to one exact tree and causing Critical consensus divergence: one supported path accepts bytes another rejects?

## Target
- File/function: src/serde/parse_atom.rs::parse_atom
- Entrypoint: public parsing or stream-analysis through `parse_atom` before execution, hashing, or serialization
- Attacker controls: truncated streams and trailing bytes
- Exploit idea: Build the smallest CLVM blob/program/API call for non-canonical long-form zero, drive it through default flags versus MEMPOOL_MODE, and compare result node, error class, cost, serialized bytes, and tree hash against the equivalent supported path.
- Invariant to test: canonical bytes must map to one exact tree
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical consensus divergence: one supported path accepts bytes another rejects
- Fast validation: add a property/fuzz seed and reject unless consensus-visible result, canonical bytes, cost, or tree hash changes; reject out-of-scope crash/DoS/performance-only/docs/tests/scripts/disabled-config/downstream-misuse outcomes.

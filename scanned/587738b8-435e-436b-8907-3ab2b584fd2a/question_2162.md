# Q2162: hash-root ambiguity in hash::update

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker submit transactions whose resulting objects share equivalent logical content but different encodings that reaches `core/crypto/src/hash.rs::update` with control over serialized forms of actions, receipts, or blocks that remain logically equivalent and make nearcore derive a canonical hash or root from representation details rather than canonical content, breaking the invariant that canonical hashes and roots must depend only on canonical content, and leading to consensus flaws?

## Target
- File/function: `core/crypto/src/hash.rs::update`
- Entrypoint: submit transactions whose resulting objects share equivalent logical content but different encodings
- Attacker controls: serialized forms of actions, receipts, or blocks that remain logically equivalent
- Exploit idea: derive a canonical hash or root from representation details rather than canonical content
- Invariant to test: canonical hashes and roots must depend only on canonical content
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus flaws
- Fast validation: write a hash-consistency test across equivalent encodings and assert all canonical hashes stay identical

# Q16925: bounded epoch-processing stall in epoch_store::store_ref

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker submit many protocol-valid stake-changing transactions in one epoch window that reaches `core/store/src/adapter/epoch_store.rs::store_ref` with control over transaction volume and structure that remain within normal user limits and make nearcore materially slow epoch processing because stake maintenance work scales worse than its validation assumptions, breaking the invariant that user-valid stake updates must remain proportionally bounded for epoch-processing liveness, and leading to high: non-network-level dos?

## Target
- File/function: `core/store/src/adapter/epoch_store.rs::store_ref`
- Entrypoint: submit many protocol-valid stake-changing transactions in one epoch window
- Attacker controls: transaction volume and structure that remain within normal user limits
- Exploit idea: materially slow epoch processing because stake maintenance work scales worse than its validation assumptions
- Invariant to test: user-valid stake updates must remain proportionally bounded for epoch-processing liveness
- Expected Immunefi impact: High: non-network-level DoS
- Fast validation: write a bounded many-stake update test and assert processing remains within metered or validated limits

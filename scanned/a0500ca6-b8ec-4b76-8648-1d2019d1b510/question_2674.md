# Q2674: stake weight ordering drift in epoch_store::get_epoch_start

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker submit multiple stake-changing transactions in one epoch window that reaches `core/store/src/adapter/epoch_store.rs::get_epoch_start` with control over ordering and grouping of stake and unstake actions for attacker-controlled accounts and make nearcore derive validator or seat weight from one transaction order while balances commit in another, breaking the invariant that validator weight selection must be computed from the same canonical stake state that balances commit, and leading to consensus flaws?

## Target
- File/function: `core/store/src/adapter/epoch_store.rs::get_epoch_start`
- Entrypoint: submit multiple stake-changing transactions in one epoch window
- Attacker controls: ordering and grouping of stake and unstake actions for attacker-controlled accounts
- Exploit idea: derive validator or seat weight from one transaction order while balances commit in another
- Invariant to test: validator weight selection must be computed from the same canonical stake state that balances commit
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus flaws
- Fast validation: write a stake-ordering test and assert validator weights remain identical under equivalent canonical transaction sets

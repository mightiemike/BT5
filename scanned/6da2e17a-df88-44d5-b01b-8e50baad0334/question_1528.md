# Q1528: gc candidate execution apply/quote nesting around allocator restore via pair path all-left versus all-right

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `gc_candidate` in `src/runtime_dialect.rs` through public CLVM execution through `gc_candidate` using run_program, ChiaDialect, RuntimeDialect, or Python execution wrapper, using a crafted apply/quote nesting around allocator restore input and the pair path all-left versus all-right validation path while controlling caller-visible flags and max_cost, so the code accepting work before the cost failure is observable, given that the hypothesis is rejected if the only effect is crash, DoS, slowdown, docs/tests, scripts, disabled config, or downstream misuse, violating the invariant that same program/env/flags/max_cost must produce identical result, error, and cost and causing Critical consensus divergence: identical spend bytes evaluate differently?

## Target
- File/function: src/runtime_dialect.rs::gc_candidate
- Entrypoint: public CLVM execution through `gc_candidate` using run_program, ChiaDialect, RuntimeDialect, or Python execution wrapper
- Attacker controls: caller-visible flags and max_cost
- Exploit idea: Build the smallest CLVM blob/program/API call for apply/quote nesting around allocator restore, drive it through pair path all-left versus all-right, and compare result node, error class, cost, serialized bytes, and tree hash against the equivalent supported path.
- Invariant to test: same program/env/flags/max_cost must produce identical result, error, and cost
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical consensus divergence: identical spend bytes evaluate differently
- Fast validation: construct two distinct inputs and assert no parser, serializer, cache, or binding path merges them; reject out-of-scope crash/DoS/performance-only/docs/tests/scripts/disabled-config/downstream-misuse outcomes.

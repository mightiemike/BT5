# Q3472: node ptr core first/rest high-bit traversal via Python Program wrapper versus low-level LazyNode

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `node_ptr` in `src/error.rs` through public CLVM parse, execute, traverse, hash, or allocator API through `node_ptr`, using a crafted first/rest high-bit traversal input and the Python Program wrapper versus low-level LazyNode validation path while controlling path atoms with leading zero and high-bit patterns, so the code computing hash or traversal over normalized instead of exact bytes, given that the attacker supplies only CLVM bytes, puzzle/solution data, exposed flags, or Python API inputs, violating the invariant that valid NodePtr type/identity must remain stable and causing Critical consensus divergence: core helpers make equivalent paths disagree?

## Target
- File/function: src/error.rs::node_ptr
- Entrypoint: public CLVM parse, execute, traverse, hash, or allocator API through `node_ptr`
- Attacker controls: path atoms with leading zero and high-bit patterns
- Exploit idea: Build the smallest CLVM blob/program/API call for first/rest high-bit traversal, drive it through Python Program wrapper versus low-level LazyNode, and compare result node, error class, cost, serialized bytes, and tree hash against the equivalent supported path.
- Invariant to test: valid NodePtr type/identity must remain stable
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical consensus divergence: core helpers make equivalent paths disagree
- Fast validation: add a property/fuzz seed and reject unless consensus-visible result, canonical bytes, cost, or tree hash changes; reject out-of-scope crash/DoS/performance-only/docs/tests/scripts/disabled-config/downstream-misuse outcomes.

# Q1031: build hasher cache PathBuilder left/right depth boundary via node_to_bytes versus node_to_bytes_limit

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `build_hasher` in `src/serde/identity_hash.rs` through public cache-backed serialization, hashing, interning, or incremental state through `build_hasher`, using a crafted PathBuilder left/right depth boundary input and the node_to_bytes versus node_to_bytes_limit validation path while controlling restore/undo sequences, so the code keeping restored state reachable to later input, given that the path is reachable through documented clvm_rs Rust or Python APIs used by wallets, nodes, or testnet services, violating the invariant that cache keys must represent exact tree identity/content and causing High stale cache error: repeated inputs return wrong nodes, lengths, hashes, or paths?

## Target
- File/function: src/serde/identity_hash.rs::build_hasher
- Entrypoint: public cache-backed serialization, hashing, interning, or incremental state through `build_hasher`
- Attacker controls: restore/undo sequences
- Exploit idea: Build the smallest CLVM blob/program/API call for PathBuilder left/right depth boundary, drive it through node_to_bytes versus node_to_bytes_limit, and compare result node, error class, cost, serialized bytes, and tree hash against the equivalent supported path.
- Invariant to test: cache keys must represent exact tree identity/content
- Expected Immunefi impact: High stale cache error: repeated inputs return wrong nodes, lengths, hashes, or paths
- Fast validation: compare direct API, round-trip API, and reference CLVM behavior on the same crafted input; reject out-of-scope crash/DoS/performance-only/docs/tests/scripts/disabled-config/downstream-misuse outcomes.

# Q19963: bounded verification skew in hash::Hash256

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker submit protocol-valid cryptographic inputs that maximize branch complexity that reaches `core/crypto/src/hash.rs::Hash256` with control over bounded signatures, proofs, or keys that trigger edge-case verification branches and make nearcore take a deterministic but context-sensitive branch that honest nodes need not interpret identically, breaking the invariant that verification outcomes and costs must be deterministic for every protocol-valid cryptographic input, and leading to consensus flaws?

## Target
- File/function: `core/crypto/src/hash.rs::Hash256`
- Entrypoint: submit protocol-valid cryptographic inputs that maximize branch complexity
- Attacker controls: bounded signatures, proofs, or keys that trigger edge-case verification branches
- Exploit idea: take a deterministic but context-sensitive branch that honest nodes need not interpret identically
- Invariant to test: verification outcomes and costs must be deterministic for every protocol-valid cryptographic input
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus flaws
- Fast validation: write a branch-heavy verification test across repeated runs and assert identical outcomes and charging

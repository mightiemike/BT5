# Q2989: parse atom parser trailing bytes after valid tree via node_to_bytes versus node_to_bytes_limit

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `parse_atom` in `src/serde/parse_atom.rs` through public parsing or stream-analysis through `parse_atom` before execution, hashing, or serialization, using a crafted trailing bytes after valid tree input and the node_to_bytes versus node_to_bytes_limit validation path while controlling backreference bytes where accepted by the path, so the code reporting success for bytes that deserialize differently later, given that the path is reachable through documented clvm_rs Rust or Python APIs used by wallets, nodes, or testnet services, violating the invariant that bytes consumed, serialized length, and cursor position must agree and causing Critical consensus divergence: one supported path accepts bytes another rejects?

## Target
- File/function: src/serde/parse_atom.rs::parse_atom
- Entrypoint: public parsing or stream-analysis through `parse_atom` before execution, hashing, or serialization
- Attacker controls: backreference bytes where accepted by the path
- Exploit idea: Build the smallest CLVM blob/program/API call for trailing bytes after valid tree, drive it through node_to_bytes versus node_to_bytes_limit, and compare result node, error class, cost, serialized bytes, and tree hash against the equivalent supported path.
- Invariant to test: bytes consumed, serialized length, and cursor position must agree
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical consensus divergence: one supported path accepts bytes another rejects
- Fast validation: compare direct API, round-trip API, and reference CLVM behavior on the same crafted input; reject out-of-scope crash/DoS/performance-only/docs/tests/scripts/disabled-config/downstream-misuse outcomes.

# Q2182: delegate action replay window in signer::from_seed

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker submit a delegate action through the normal transaction path that reaches `core/crypto/src/signer.rs::from_seed` with control over a previously accepted delegated payload plus a reordered or repeated submission schedule and make nearcore let a once-valid delegated payload execute more than once or in a different execution context, breaking the invariant that a delegated action may execute at most once and only in the exact signed context, and leading to transaction manipulation?

## Target
- File/function: `core/crypto/src/signer.rs::from_seed`
- Entrypoint: submit a delegate action through the normal transaction path
- Attacker controls: a previously accepted delegated payload plus a reordered or repeated submission schedule
- Exploit idea: let a once-valid delegated payload execute more than once or in a different execution context
- Invariant to test: a delegated action may execute at most once and only in the exact signed context
- Expected Immunefi impact: Transaction manipulation
- Fast validation: write a replay test that resubmits the same delegated payload across reordered blocks and assert only one execution path can succeed

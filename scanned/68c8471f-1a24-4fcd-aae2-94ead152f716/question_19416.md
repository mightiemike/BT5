# Q19416: bounded execution stall in internal::extract_address

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker submit a transaction with large but protocol-valid execution inputs that reaches `runtime/near-wallet-contract/implementation/wallet-contract/src/internal.rs::extract_address` with control over method args, receipt fanout, and bounded Wasm or storage operations and make nearcore hit an unexpectedly expensive runtime path that blocks block processing before gas or deposit limits stop it, breaking the invariant that bounded user execution must remain proportionally metered and abort before materially stalling block production, and leading to high: non-network-level dos?

## Target
- File/function: `runtime/near-wallet-contract/implementation/wallet-contract/src/internal.rs::extract_address`
- Entrypoint: submit a transaction with large but protocol-valid execution inputs
- Attacker controls: method args, receipt fanout, and bounded Wasm or storage operations
- Exploit idea: hit an unexpectedly expensive runtime path that blocks block processing before gas or deposit limits stop it
- Invariant to test: bounded user execution must remain proportionally metered and abort before materially stalling block production
- Expected Immunefi impact: High: non-network-level DoS
- Fast validation: write a bounded worst-case execution test and assert gas or validation aborts before block-processing work grows disproportionately

# Q2577: save cursor binding format auto magic-prefix boundary via stream hash versus tree hash

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `save_cursor` in `wheel/python/clvm_rs/de.py` through public Python/Rust binding API `save_cursor` with attacker-controlled Python or byte inputs, using a crafted format auto magic-prefix boundary input and the stream hash versus tree hash validation path while controlling bytes, memoryview, and integer casting boundaries, so the code returning Python-visible result, error, cost, bytes, or hash different from Rust core, given that no privileged role, leaked key, admin action, trusted operator, or mainnet testing is required, violating the invariant that Python and Rust APIs must agree on result/cost/error/bytes/hash and causing High Python/Rust API divergence: callers see different result/cost/error/bytes/hash?

## Target
- File/function: wheel/python/clvm_rs/de.py::save_cursor
- Entrypoint: public Python/Rust binding API `save_cursor` with attacker-controlled Python or byte inputs
- Attacker controls: bytes, memoryview, and integer casting boundaries
- Exploit idea: Build the smallest CLVM blob/program/API call for format auto magic-prefix boundary, drive it through stream hash versus tree hash, and compare result node, error class, cost, serialized bytes, and tree hash against the equivalent supported path.
- Invariant to test: Python and Rust APIs must agree on result/cost/error/bytes/hash
- Expected Immunefi impact: High Python/Rust API divergence: callers see different result/cost/error/bytes/hash
- Fast validation: write a Rust regression test and Python wheel comparison for exact result/error/cost/bytes/hash agreement; reject out-of-scope crash/DoS/performance-only/docs/tests/scripts/disabled-config/downstream-misuse outcomes.
